# Covid-19-Vaccine-Side-Effect-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
ML-based model to predict the severity of COVID-19 vaccine side effects using VAERS data. Includes data preprocessing, class balancing (SMOTE), and models like Random Forest to classify reports as severe or non-severe, aiding in vaccine safety analysis.

ü¶† COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect Predictor
This project uses machine learning to predict the severity of COVID-19 vaccine side effects using real-world data from the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database.

üìå Project Overview
The goal is to classify vaccine reaction reports into:

Severe Side Effects

No Severity

This helps in analyzing vaccine safety and supporting public health decision-making.
